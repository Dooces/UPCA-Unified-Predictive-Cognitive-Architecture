# UPCA — Unified Predictive Cognitive Architecture

**One control loop:** variational free energy + precision (Γ) + ethical prior (η).  
Closed-form, testable signals for **laughter** L(t), **qualia intensity** Q(t), and **grounded meaning** via fast/slow F with η-gating.

---

## TL;DR
UPCA gives operational equations for phenomena people hand-wave (laughter timing, qualia intensity, meaning grounding) and puts them in a single, implementable control loop that runs today.

## Quickstart
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dooces/UPCA-Unified-Predictive-Cognitive-Architecture.git
cd UPCA-Unified-Predictive-Cognitive-Architecture
python upca_min.py
